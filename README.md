# Boston Airbnb Data Analysis

## Objective
As part of Udacity's Data Science project, my focus was on the Boston Airbnb dataset. I aimed to address several key questions during my analysis:

> I investigated the correlation between price and the number of accommodations.

> I examined the relationship between price and the number of beds.

> I sought to determine the total monthly rental activity.

> I explored the correlation between review scores and prices, taking into account different neighborhoods.

> I delved into the correlation between price, host response rate, and reviews.



## Result

> Winter months, particularly in January, saw a higher influx of Airbnb rentals in Boston.

> Depending on the neighborhood, rental prices in Boston can vary significantly, ranging from as low as $40 to nearly $350.

> As the number of accommodations and beds increases, there is a corresponding increase in the rental price.

> The chart displayed above illustrates the following observations:

> Many hosts maintain a substantial host response rate, which correlates with a high host acceptance rate.

> A notable host response rate is also associated with an increased likelihood of receiving higher review scores.

> Higher rental prices appear to be linked to an increased likelihood of achieving higher review scores, possibly indicating the quality of the rental or the influence of psychological factors.
