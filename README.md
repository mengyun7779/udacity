# Udacity-Boston-AirBNB-Data-Science

## Objective
As my first project for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree, I worked on the data of AirBNB in Boston. There were a few questions I had in mind regarding the dataset that I tried to find. These Questions were the following:
> The correlation between price and the number of accomodates.

> The correlation between price and the number of beds

> Total number rentals in a month

> Correlation between review scores and prices based on neighbourhood

> Correlation of price with the response rate of the host and reviews

I have also written a Medium Blog Post about it which can be accessed here.

## Libraries Used

> Pandas

> Numpy

> Matplotlib

> Seaborn


## Files Used

> lisings.csv

> calender.csv

> reviews.csv


## Result

> More people rented an AirBNB at Boston During Winters peaking during January

> Depending upon the Neighbourhood, the price ranges from as low as $40 to almost $350

> With increase in Accomodates and beds, the the price too increases

> The plot above shows the following:

> A lot of them have a high host response rate which also shows its correlation with a high host acceptance rate
> A high host response rate also gets you a higher chance of a higher review score
> A high price also gives a higher chance of getting a higher review probably because either the place of rent is actually good or it could also be psychological
